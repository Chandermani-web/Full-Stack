---------------------------------------------------🧠 What is AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)-----------------------------------------------------------

AST is a tree-like structure that represents your code in a way that the JavaScript engine or compiler can understand and work with.

Think of it as:

💬 "A diagram or map of your code that explains what it means."

🔍 Simple Example:
Let’s take this simple JavaScript code:
let x = 5 + 3;
This is what you write.
But the JavaScript engine (like V8) converts it to something like this:

VariableDeclaration
 └─ Identifier: x
 └─ BinaryExpression
     ├─ Literal: 5
     ├─ Operator: +
     └─ Literal: 3
This is the AST.

🧱 Structure of AST

Nodes → Each element of the code (variable, operator, function, etc.) is a node.
Tree → The entire code is structured like a family tree.
Hierarchy → Helps the engine understand which part comes first, what depends on what.

📦 Why AST is Important?
Use Case							Explanation
✅ Parsing Code							JS engines convert source code to AST before running
✅ Code Transformation						Tools like Babel, ESLint, Prettier use AST to modify or format code
✅ Linting & Errors						AST helps in understanding syntax errors
✅ Minification							Compressing JS code uses AST
✅ Transpilation						Babel converts modern JS to older versions using AST

🛠 Tools That Use AST:
Babel – Converts modern JS (ES6+) to old JS
ESLint – Linting rules
Prettier – Code formatting
Webpack – Bundling
TypeScript Compiler – Converts TS to JS

🧪 Real World Analogy:
📄 You write a sentence in English:
"Ali eats an apple."

🧠 AST would be:

Subject → Ali
Verb → eats
Object → an apple

This is how the computer understands your code grammatically.

🔗 Summary:
AST = A tree representation of your source code that the JS engine or compiler builds before executing it.
It helps in syntax checking, transformation, optimization, and execution.
